As a Workday admin I want to synchronize Workers between Workday and SAP.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.

1. The integration is triggered by poll to Workday instance. New or modified workers are passed to the batch as input.
2. In the batch the employee is fetched from SAP by the e-mail and mapped to SAP input data structure.
3. Afterwards every employee is sent to destination instance - to SAP where it is asynchronously updated or created.

			<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.

You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** 
These dependencies are private for Mulesoft and will cause you application not to build from a Maven command line. You need to replace them with "provided" scope and copy the libraries into the build path.
